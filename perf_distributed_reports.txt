1. remoting (6 clients, 150k messages):
client - 3-7% cpu, 7 mb
server - 26-36% cpu, 9 mb
time - 291 sec

2. zeromq (6 clients, 150k messages):
client - 3-7% cpu, 9 mb
server - 18-22% cpu, 9 mb
time - 442 sec

3. netmq (6 clients, 150k messages):
client - 3-8% cpu, 11 mb
server - 19-24% cpu, 11 mb
time - 486 sec

4. zyan (6 clients, 150k messages):
client - 4-8% cpu, 7.5 mb
server - 30-42% cpu, 9 mb
time - 635 sec

5. thrift (relatively fast, quickly become unusable - 10 clients * 4k messages results in socket buffer overflow)

6. wcf (too slow for 100k messages case or 1k messages * 10 clients case)

7. msmq (too slow for simple cases - 10k messages in one client) - creating temporary queues is very expensive - finally removed
