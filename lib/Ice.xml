            Utility base class that makes it easy to correctly initialize and finalize
            the Ice run time, as well as handle signals. Unless the application specifies
            a logger, Application installs a per-process logger that logs to the standard
            error output.

            Installing a

            throws AlreadyRegisteredException.
            
            When unmarshaling an Ice object, the Ice run time reads the
            most-derived type id off the wire and attempts to create an
            instance of the type using a factory. If no instance is created,
            either because no factory was found, or because all factories
            returned nil, the behavior of the Ice run time depends on the
            format with which the object was marshaled:
            
            If the object uses the "sliced" format, Ice ascends the class
            hierarchy until it finds a type that is recognized by a factory,
            or it reaches the least-derived type. If no factory is found that
            can create an instance, the run time throws
            NoObjectFactoryException.
            
            If the object uses the "compact" format, Ice immediately raises
            NoObjectFactoryException.

            Note that the object adapter does not automatically insert

            is marshaled back to the client. If the Slice definition for the

            If locate throws any exception, the Ice run time does not

            <summary>
            Called by the object adapter after a request has been
            made.
            This operation is only called if locate was called
            prior to the request and returned a non-null servant. This
            operation can be used for cleanup purposes after a request.
            
            finished can throw any user exception. If it does, that exception
            is marshaled back to the client. If the Slice definition for the
            corresponding operation includes that user exception, the client
            receives that user exception; otherwise, the client receives
            UnknownUserException.
            
            If both the operation and finished throw an exception, the
            exception thrown by finished is marshaled back to the client.
